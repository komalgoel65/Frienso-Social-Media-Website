# Frienso-Social-Media-Website
Frienso is a simple and interactive "social media website" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed with a focus on front-end development,that mimics the structure and functionality of a basic social networking site. Users can explore a clean and modern layout with features like a post feed UI, profile page templates, navigation bar, and interactive elements such as like and comment buttons (for demonstration purposes). 
The website is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices. One of the key highlights of Frienso is its easy customizationâ€”users can change the theme, adjust font sizes, and modify color schemes to personalize the interface to their liking. This project showcases core front-end development skills and is perfect for beginners looking to understand layout design, styling, and interactivity. It also serves as a solid foundation for adding advanced features like user authentication, database connectivity, or real-time messaging. 
Looking ahead, AI integration can enhance Frienso with intelligent features such as personalized content recommendations, smart chatbots for user support, automatic moderation of comments or posts using natural language processing (NLP), and AI-generated captions or summaries for shared content.
